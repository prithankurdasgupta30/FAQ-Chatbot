# FAQ-Chatbot
This project is a fully local, AI-powered FAQ chatbot built using SentenceTransformers, semantic search, and Streamlit. It allows users to ask natural language questions and instantly retrieves the most relevant answer from a CSV-based FAQ dataset — without using any external APIs, cloud services, or paid LLMs.
