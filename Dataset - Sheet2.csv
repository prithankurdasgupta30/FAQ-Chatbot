Power BI or Tableau which one is better?,"""This is a contextual question. If you are talking about a pure visualization tool Tableau is slightly better.

Since most companies use excel & Microsoft tools they start with Power BI or move towards Power BI for seamless integration with other Microsoft tools (called as Power platform).

Also, Power BI has been leading the Gartner’s magic quadrant in BI for the last few years as the industry leader."""
